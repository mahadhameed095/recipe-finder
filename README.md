# QuoteFinder

Find a quote to support any argument! Weaviate will use hybrid search, a combination of semantic search and keyword search, to find the quotes that best match your query. Semantic search allows you to search on the meaning of the text, which is great for big ideas or general arguments, while keyword search looks for exact matches between the query and the quotes, which works well if you have an exact phrase in mind.
